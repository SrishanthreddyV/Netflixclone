# 🎬 Netflix India Landing Page Clone

A responsive and pixel-perfect **clone of Netflix India’s landing page**, built using **pure HTML5 and CSS3**. This project is designed to replicate the visual design, layout, and content flow of the official Netflix homepage — including the hero banner, feature highlights, FAQs, and a multilingual dropdown.

## 🔍 Motivation

I created this project as a way to:

- Practice responsive web design with only HTML & CSS
- Recreate a real-world UI/UX from a globally recognized brand
- Understand layout structuring, semantic tags, and animations
- Strengthen my front-end development fundamentals without using frameworks or JavaScript

## 📘 What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Semantic HTML and layout best practices
- CSS Flexbox and Grid systems for responsive design
- CSS-only dropdowns and accordion components
- Media queries for mobile-first design
- Custom animations using `@keyframes`
- Layering with `z-index` and overlays
- Form accessibility using `datalist`

## 🧩 Challenges I Faced

- Creating a **pure CSS dropdown menu** with language options
- Embedding and aligning **autoplay videos** inside device frames
- Ensuring the **FAQ accordion** expands/collapses smoothly and consistently
- Making the **hero section responsive** across all screen sizes
- Structuring the **footer layout** to match Netflix’s 4-column design

Each challenge helped me push my CSS skills further and gave me insight into real-world layout issues.
